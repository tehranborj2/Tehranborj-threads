Wabel's Threads.io PHP plug
===========================

What is this?
-------------

This project is a PHP connector to [Threads.io](http://threads.io). Use this plug to identify your users, track events and page visits or remove them from your Threads.io account.

Initialize
----------

Here is a basic example on how you can use Wabel's Threads.io PHP Plug :

```php
use \Wabel\ThreadsIo\ThreadsIoClient;
use \Wabel\ThreadsIo\ThreadsIoService;

// The ThreadsIoClient class is the low level class used to make the API calls.
// It takes your eventKey in parameter, which is provided to you by Threads.io
$client = new ThreadsIoClient(YOUR_EVENT_KEY);

// The ThreadsIoService class is the high level class that you will use with the Entities to make your API Calls
// It takes your fresh new ThreadsIoClient object in argument to be instantiate
$service = new ThreadsIoClient($client);
```

The two main compound of this package are the **ThreadsIoClient** and **ThreadsIoService**.

The **ThreadsIoClient** is a programmatic implementation of the Threads.io API. It ensures that the data are sent with the format expected by the API.
The **ThreadsIoService** is the main class to instantiate and use. It's meant to use the package Entity system, meaning manipulating **Users**, **Event** and **Page** objects easily. Every call methods expects an object implementing the **<Entity>ThreadableInterface** or one of the provided Entity of this package.

Interfaces and Entites
----------------------

As explained earlier, the **ThreadsIoService** is manipulating entities. A User entity, Event entity or Page entity is the instantiation of an existing class of your PHP application implementing respectively the **UserThreadableInterface**, **EventThreadableInterface**, **PageThreadableInterface**. For instance, a Member class that is used for manipulating users in your application is a good candidate for implementing the **UserThreadable** interface.
If you have no classes that could implement the ThreadableInterfaces, you can instantiate manually one of the Wabel\Entities (User, Event or Page) provided in this package.

```php
use \Wabel\ThreadsIo\Entities\User;
use \Wabel\ThreadsIo\Entities\Event;
use \Wabel\ThreadsIo\Entities\Page;

// Whether you retrieve an object implementing the UserThreadableInterface from your DB...
$yourUser = $dao->getMemberById(2103);

// ...or that you create one using the provided entity class User...
$threadsIoUser = new User("ID254632", [
    "name" => "Jesus Christ",
    "company" => "Christian Church",
    "date_of_birth" => "24/12/0001",
]);

...

// ... you'll be able to use them both with the ThreadsIoService
$service->identify($yourUser);
$service->identify($threadsIoUser);
```

How to use the ThreadsIoService
-------------------------------

In version 1.0.0, we introduced the first use of the basic functions "identify", "track", "page" and "remove".
Here's a basic usage of the service :


```php
use \Wabel\ThreadsIo\Entities\User;
use \Wabel\ThreadsIo\Entities\Event;
use \Wabel\ThreadsIo\Entities\Page;
use \Wabel\ThreadsIo\ThreadsIoClient;
use \Wabel\ThreadsIo\ThreadsIoService;

// Instantiate an object that implements one of the Wabel\ThreadsIo\Interfaces
// (one of the provided classes in this case)
$user = new User("4815162342", [
     "name" => "Hugo Reyes",
     "status" => "Lost",
     "other" => "Lottery winner"
 ]);

$event = new Event("New Lost Person Report", [
     "plane" => "Oceanic 815",
     "crash_location" => "Pacific Ocean"
 ]);

$page = new Page("New plane crash: Oceanic 815 on fire in the Pacific Ocean", [
     "url" => "http://www.bignews.com/New-plane-crash-Oceanic-815-on-fire-in-the-Pacific-Ocean",
     "referer" => "http://www.bignews.com",
     "time_spent_on_page" => "18s"
 ]);

// Then grab or create a ThreadsIoService object
$client = new ThreadsIoClient($eventKey);
$service = new ThreadsIoService($client);

// Your now able to :

// Identify a user
$service->identify($user);

// Track an event
$service->track($user, $event);

// Track a page view
$service->page($user, $page);

// Remove a user
$service->remove($user);

```
